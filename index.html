        <p class="fs-4">
            Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer,
            and futurist best known for his contributions to the development of alternating current (AC)
            electrical systems. He was born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia).
        </p>
        <p class="fs-4">
            Tesla's work laid the foundation for many modern electrical systems and technologies. His inventions
            include the alternating current power transmission system, the Tesla coil, and the development of wireless
            transmission of energy.
